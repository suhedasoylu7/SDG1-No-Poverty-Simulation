SDG 1 – No Poverty Interactive Website

Project Overview
This project is an interactive website created for a Web Development assignment. It focuses on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) and aims to help users understand the challenges of living with limited income. The website includes educational content, a simulation of daily life on a limited budget, and interactive features to engage users.

The goal of the simulation is to demonstrate how everyday choices, such as paying rent, buying groceries, or managing unexpected expenses, impact money, food, and stress levels. The experience reflects the reality that poverty is complex, involving low wages, rising costs, and stress—not simply laziness or poor decision-making.


Features

  Landing Page
- Introduction to SDG 1 with a title, subtitle, and "Start Simulation" button.
- Background image with overlay for readability.
- Smooth scrolling navigation to different sections of the website.


  SDG Info
- Explains SDG 1 and the challenges of poverty.
- Carousel of images with captions highlighting different aspects of poverty.
- Carousel supports automatic cycling and manual next/previous controls.
- Hovering over the carousel pauses the automatic cycling.


  Myth vs Reality
- Interactive cards presenting common myths about poverty.
- Users can reveal the reality behind each myth by clicking a button.


  Simulation
- Users select their monthly income and family size to start the simulation.
- Daily events affect money, food, and stress levels.
- Users make choices that directly influence the outcome of the simulation.
- Status bar updates dynamically in real-time.
- Simulation ends either after 30 days or if critical conditions are reached.
- "Go Back Home" button allows users to return to the landing page.


  End Section
- Provides a summary message emphasizing empathy, awareness, and collective action 
  to reduce poverty.


  Technologies Used
- HTML5 – Structure and content of the website.
- CSS3 – Styling, layout, and responsive design.
- JavaScript (Vanilla & jQuery) – Interactivity, event handling, and simulation logic.
- jQuery – DOM manipulation, smooth scrolling, and dynamic updates.
