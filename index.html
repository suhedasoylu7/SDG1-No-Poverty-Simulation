  <h2>What is SDG 1: No Poverty?</h2>
  <div class="sdg-text">
    <p>
      Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.
      Poverty is not only about low income, but also about limited access to basic needs
      such as food, healthcare, education, housing, and social protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people experiencing poverty work hard every day, yet still struggle to survive
      due to low wages, rising living costs, and unexpected expenses such as medical bills
      or transportation. These challenges create a cycle that is difficult to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simulation helps users understand how daily decisions, even small ones,
      can have long-term effects on financial stability, stress, and well-being.
      It reflects the reality that there are often no perfect choices when resources are limited.
